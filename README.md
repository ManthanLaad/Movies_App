TASK FOR AJENCY FULL STACK DEVELOPER ROLE

I have converted my api project to a fullstack project using node js for backend and mongoDB atlas for database. The site is not completely mobile responsive but can be used in mobile view. The "/addMovies" path is set to add movies to the site database from the TMDB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

I have used the UI from and previous task for frontend and have also referred stackoverflow.com to complete the task.
